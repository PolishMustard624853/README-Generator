# 09 Node.js Homework: Professional README Generator

## Description
<!-- Description of assignment -->
This homework assignment was to generate a READEME file for ease of access for a business so that we do not have to create an entire README every time our business makes a new project.

## Personal Comments
<!-- Personal comments on hw -->
I tried to make this functional as best as I could using only unit-10-node.js class material as a reference.
I keep running into errors and am unsure as to what they all mean so this is not working properly.....
